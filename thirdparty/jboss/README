To build this module, call 

build.sh thirdparty

or

build.bat thirdparty

from the root directory of the eXist distribution.

2 service archives are created, one which is the actual service and 
one which is a simple jmx based client to this service. 

Just copy them both to the jboss deploy directory to deploy them and 
you can then play with the client through the jboss management interface
to get a feel for how it works. In this example I chose to bind the actual
jmx service to JNDI for simple access from other server components such as 
servlets and session beans but this might now be what you want. In some 
cases it might be more appropriate to bind several object to JNDI such as 
a base collection and maybe the CollectionManagementService etc. it depends
on the requirements of your system.
