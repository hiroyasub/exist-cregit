           Helper script for easy obtaining the latest eXist sources
           from the CVS server.
           
           Please note that "init" requires that the current folder is called 
           "eXist-1.0". It doesn't seem to be possible to checkout directly 
           into the  current folder. This is a cvs limitation.
           
           The script can be used to "checkout" files from CVS from scratch.
           Target "update" requires that a checkout has been performed.
           
           Quote from the ant - documentation: 
           This task needs "cvs" on the path. If it isn't, you will get an 
           error (such as error 2 on windows). If <cvs> doesn't work, try to 
           execute cvs.exe from the command line in the target directory in 
           which you are working.
