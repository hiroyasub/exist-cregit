(You will not be required to justify it to the  *    Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the  *    fee.)  *  *    "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees  *    involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under  *    the same conditions they received it.  *  *    1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this  *    Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and  *    associated disclaimers.  *  *    2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain  *    or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the  *    Standard Version.  *  *    3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a  *    prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that  *    you do at least ONE of the following:  *  *        a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely  *        Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or  *        placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the  *        Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.  *  *        b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.  *  *        c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard  *        executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each  *        non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard  *        Version.  *  *        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.  *  *    4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that  *    you do at least ONE of the following:  *  *        a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with  *        instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.  *  *        b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with  *        your modifications.  *  *        c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version  *        executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly  *        documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions  *        on where to get the Standard Version.  *  *        d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.  *  *    5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge  *    any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  *    However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as  *    part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this  *    Package as a product of your own.  *  *    6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this  *    Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever  *    generated them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.  *  *    7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of  *    this Package.  *  *    8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from  *    this software without specific prior written permission.  *  *    9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED  *    WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  *    MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  *  */
