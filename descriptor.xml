		request-replay-log:		Controls whether the Server logs incoming requests
								to the file request-replay-log.txt. This is useful for reproducing eXist behaviour and
								can be used in combination with the eXist Request Replayer (see tools/requestlog).
								Should be set to either true or false, most people will have no need for this.

								Note - HTTP, REST, XML-RPC, Cocoon are supported, but within those HTTP PUT, HTTP POST form file uploads, HTTP POST XUpdate are not yet supported!

			In this section, the path to an XQuery, folder or collection of XQueries may be set as allowing viewable source,
			this means that if you call an XQuery with the request parameter _source=yes, the query will not be executed
			and instead the source code of the query will be shown.
			
			BEWARE the security consequences of enabling this for your queries!

			REST XQuery paths (EXistServlet/RESTServer) start from the db location e.g. /db/mycollection/myquery.xql
			FileSystem XQuery paths (XQueryServlet) start from the root filesystem location e.g. $EXIST/HOME/webapp/myapp/myquery.xql and end with a .xql suffix
			Cocoon XQuery Paths (XQueryGenerator) are not yet supported!

			In this section, the path to a resource or collection may be mapped to a different

			a folder accessed through REST (much like the default document functionality of a webserver)
			or perhaps mapping an old collection path that you had publicised to a newer collection path.
