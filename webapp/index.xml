            <p>eXist is an Open Source native XML database featuring
                efficient, index-based 
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery</a>
                processing, automatic indexing,
                extensions for full-text search, 
                <a href="http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/">XUpdate</a> support 
                and tight integration with existing XML development 
                tools. The database implements the current 
            XQuery 1.0 working draft as
            of November, 2003, with the exception of the XML schema related
            features.</p>

            <p>The new <a href="xquery.xml">XQuery support</a> in eXist makes it possible to write 
            entire web applications with just XQuery and XSLT. XQuery files can be
            directly passed to the database, using either the XQueryServlet,
            the XQueryGenerator for Cocoon or the REST-style API
            (see <a href="devguide.xml">Developer's Guide</a>).</p> 
            
            <p>Implemented features include: user-defined functions and modules, 
            static type checking, type casts, constructors, order by, ...</p>
            
            <p>Additional features: Java binding, fultext-search functions, 
            extension modules for HTTP support, database manipulation and 
            XSL transformations.</p>
            
            <p>To avoid memory-intensive document tree
            traversals during query processing, eXist uses an efficient
            index structure which is based on a numerical indexing scheme
            for identifying XML nodes in the index. The database is
            lightweight, completely written in Java and may be easily
            deployed in a number of ways, running either as a stand-alone
            server process, inside a servlet-engine or directly embedded
            into an application.</p>

            <p>eXist is released to the public under the terms of the <link href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU
					LGPL</link> license.</p>
            <p>eXist may be downloaded either as a package containing the
                complete distribution or as a web application archive
                (war-file). Download the war-file if you want to install eXist
				into an existing servlet-engine or write your own web 
				application. To get started, we suggest downloading the 
				installer or the zip package. Both contain a ready-to-run
				webserver (Jetty).</p>
            <p>The distribution includes source code and all required third
                party libraries. The current version is 1.0beta1. For instructions on starting eXist,
                read the <link href="quickstart.xml">Quick Start Guide</link>.</p>

            <p><emphasis>If you are updating from a previous release, please do
                    a backup of your old data first, then restore it into the
                    new release. The binary format of the data files
                    changed!</emphasis></p>
