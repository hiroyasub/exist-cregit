					up a few <link href="xquery/index.xml">XQuery 
					examples</link>
				to demonstrate some of the new features available in the 
				current development version. XQuery support is still far from 
				being complete, but you can already do a lot of fascinating

					<def>0.9.2 is out! This is the first official release with support for
						XUpdate. Also, much effort has been invested to ensure
						that East Asian character encodings are correctly processed by the database
						as well as the query engine. Further changes include: important missing 
						parts of the XPath spec have been implemented, more synchronization and
						database corruption bugs have been fixed and interfaces improved.

            		</term>
            		<def>0.9.1 released! This is mainly a maintenance release, fixing many
            		bugs found in 0.9, including eof exceptions, out-of-memory errors,
            		and corrupted database files. It also contains further performance
            		optimizations with respect to indexing and querying speed. New features
            		include the highlighting of search terms in query results, simpler
            		database startup, access to index information, new Cocoon examples, 
            		and an IzPack-based installer. For a complete list of changes see

            <p>eXist is an Open Source native XML database featuring efficient, 
            	index-based XPath query processing, extensions for keyword search,
            	XUpdate support and tight integration with existing XML development tools. 
            	The database is lightweight, completely written in Java and may be easily deployed in a
                number of ways, running either as a stand-alone server process,
                inside a servlet-engine or directly embedded into an application.</p>
            <p>Depending on how the database engine has
                been deployed, eXist offers several interfaces to application
                developers, including HTTP, XML-RPC, SOAP and WebDAV. Java
                developers should have a look at the <link
                    href="http://www.xmldb.org">XML:DB API</link>, which
                provides a common interface to access XML database services.</p>
            <p>eXist integrates well with <link
                    href="http://xml.apache.org/cocoon">Apache's Cocoon</link>,
                allowing developers to create complex web applications entirely
                based on XML and related technologies.</p>

                party libraries. Java version 1.4 or above is needed. The distribution has been
                tested on Linux, Solaris and Windows 2000/ME with Suns JDK 1.4
                and IBM JDK 1.4. If you experience any problems on other
                operating systems, please send me a bug report.</p>

                        - x single XML-nodes per document, where x = 0 for an
                        ideally well-balanced document tree. To keep x small,
