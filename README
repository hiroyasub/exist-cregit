eXist Native XML Database - Version 1.0 beta1
=============================================

For instructions on how to install and start eXist, please
refer to http://exist-db.org/quickstart.html. Alternatively 
you may directly start the database with the included Jetty 
webserver and read the documentation which will be available at

http://localhost:8080/exist/

To start eXist on Windows, double click on the created desktop
icon ("eXist Database Startup") or the corresponding entry in the
start menu.

On other operating systems, change into the location where you
installed eXist and call

bin/startup.sh or bin/startup.bat

If these scripts don't work for you, try to call Java manually:

java -jar start.jar jetty

Upgrading from an older version
==============================

When updating from 1.0b1, just installing the new release over 
the old installation will not work. The binary storage format of the
database files and the encoding of passwords have changed. In particular, 
the old md5-encoded passwords in /db/system/users.xml don't match the 
keys generated by the 1.0b2 release (we had to change the encoding
in order to support HTTP digest authentication as required by WebDAV). 
Restoring the data from a backup doesn't help as the old md5 keys 
are restored.

To migrate your data to the new release, you should first create a backup
of the old data using the backup feature of the Java client. Backup is fastest
if you stop any running server and start the client from the old installation
directory in local mode:

bin/client.sh -l

You can then later switch to the new installation directory and do a restore.
Concerning user passwords, there are two possiblities:

1) before doing the restore, edit /db/system/users.xml in your backup directory 
and remove the password attribute in each user. Then restore into a fresh 
database. All users will now have an empty password and you can give them a new one.

2) if you have to preserve the old passwords, edit src/org/exist/security/security.properties 
to switch back to the old password encoding scheme. The file should contain:

passwords.encoding=simple-md5

then rebuild the jars by calling build.bat or build.sh.
