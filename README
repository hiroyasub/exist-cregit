eXist Native XML Database - Version 1.0 beta1
=============================================

For instructions on how to install and start eXist, please
refer to http://exist-db.org/quickstart.html. Alternatively 
you may directly start the database with the included Jetty 
webserver and read the documentation which will be available at

http://localhost:8080/exist/

To start eXist on Windows, double click on the created desktop
icon ("eXist Database Startup") or the corresponding entry in the
start menu.

On other operating systems, change into the location where you
installed eXist and call

bin/startup.sh or bin/startup.bat

If these scripts don't work for you, try to call Java manually:

java -jar start.jar jetty
